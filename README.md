# ReminderToText

I always forget to text people. When I get busy, I forget to text my friends and family. 

Def not good, one idea would be to have an app, or a script, that sends you notifications/or emails as a reminder

Crazy simple ui, u list the name and frequency of how often do you want to be reminded.

Done, for now

Lazy to do the implementation yet, but feel free to pr, we could do smth cool together.

Feel free to steal it too, but better share so i can use it too lol
